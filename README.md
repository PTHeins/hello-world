# hello-world
This is a repository to help me get familiar with Github's features.

The tutorial told me to write a bit about myself here.
So uh, I'm a college student working on a computer science degree.
I'm trying to get to know how github works from a project development point of view so that I can perform well at my internship.
That should be enough for testing purposes. Thank you for stopping by the Readme.
